        <p>Like any respectable designer I take photographs, play music, and generally try not to sit in front of my computer. I’m a fan of documentaries, small animals, travel, skiing, tennis, and sitting in bars with friends debating the merits of various bands. I live in San Francisco with my wife, Jennifer, and our cat, Kali, for a while with <a href="https://vimeo.com/89194919">this couple</a> who would visit nearly every morning and, as you can see, talk about me disparagingly.</p>
