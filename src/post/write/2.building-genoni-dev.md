As it has been in the past, rebuilding my website is an opportunity to try out approaches I’d learned in the past few years. Instead of using an existing static-site generator I decided to build one from scratch, both to better understand and control each piece of the build phase and optimize the client-side output for speed.

## Build process

**1. Node & Nunjucks.**

1. Markdown with [front-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/front-matter) as source files for all content.
2. A custom [Node script](https://github.com/tomgenoni/genoni-dev/blob/master/app/content.js) to read in, convert, and combine the Markdown data.
3. [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for templating.

I originally built the site with Handlebars.js but found I was needing to do more conditionals than it comfortably supports.

**2. Bash script.** One of the benefits of using `npm` is the ease with which you can store aliases to commands in a `package.json` file. But this is cumbersome if you have more than a few scripts to manage. Moving the commands into a bash file, as described in [An alternative to npm scripts](https://james-forbes.com/?/posts/alternative-to-npm-scripts#!/posts/alternative-to-npm-scripts), makes it far easier to manage and organize.

Instead of a `package.json` file with a list of scripts&hellip;

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "css:scss": "node-sass -q src/asset/scss/root.scss tmp/root.css && node-sass -q src/asset/scss/roll.scss tmp/roll.css",
  "css:postcss": "postcss tmp/root.css --no-map --use css-mqpacker cssnano -o dist/asset/css/root.css && postcss tmp/roll.css --no-map --use cssnano -o dist/asset/css/roll.css",
    ...
}
```

&hellip; we put them in functions inside `scripts.sh`. This means we can structure the file however we like, add comments and console output, and more easily make changes.

```bash
function css:scss() {
  # Build CSS
  echo 'css...'
  node-sass -q src/asset/scss/root.scss tmp/root.css && \
  node-sass -q src/asset/scss/roll.scss tmp/roll.css && \
  echo '✔ scss'
}

function css:postcss() {
  # Run `mqpacker` to sort by breakpoint, cssnano to minify
  postcss tmp/root.css --no-map --use css-mqpacker cssnano -o dist/asset/css/root.css && \
  postcss tmp/roll.css --no-map --use cssnano -o dist/asset/css/roll.css && \
  echo '✔ postcss'
}
```

The `package.json` [scripts section](https://github.com/tomgenoni/genoni-dev/blob/master/scripts.sh) is now greatly simplified, replacing previously lengthy commands with references to bash rollup functions than include other functions.

```javascript
"scripts": {
  ...
  "css:dev": "bash scripts.sh css:dev",
  "css:prod": "bash scripts.sh css:prod",
  ...
}
```

**3. CSS manipulations.** A few [postcss](https://postcss.org/) packages gets the CSS as small as possible.

1. [css-mqpacker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-mqpacker) to sort by breakpoints.
2. [cssnano](https://cssnano.co) for a bunch of optimizations.

**4. Local build.**

1. [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) with [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) watches files and directories to trigger rebuilds.
2. [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/) serves and auto-refreshes the site for local development.
3. [prismjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prismjs) for code example syntax highlighting

**5. Production build.** On pushes to `master` the site is rebuilt and served by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Here we run a few other optimizations.

1. [html-minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier) on the HTML and CSS files.
2. [node-minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-minify) for the JS files.
3. [purgecss](https://www.purgecss.com/) to remove unused CSS.
4. [sitemap-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sitemap-generator) to build my very simple [sitemap](https://github.com/tomgenoni/genoni-dev/blob/master/app/sitemap.js).

Running purgecss is a little risky as it relies on a scan of the output HTML to determine what classes to remove. This means classes introduced by JavaScript can get discarded unless whitelisted in a config. But when managed correctly it can significantly reduce the CSS output.

## Client side

Now we’re ready to send the HTML to the user.

**1. Responsive images.** Adding images to sites is like opening a nesting doll, one issue leads to another and another&hellip;

-   **A Goldilocks problem.** Depending on the image resolution, its rendered width, and the device that’s requesting it, it’s either too small and renders fuzzy or too big and the page load time goes up, also sending excess data to the user. Multiply this by 10 or 100 images on a web page and you have a mess. This is where [responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) comes in, relying on the browser to choose the right image among many options. Problem solved! Except this means you need 12 (more or less) different sizes of that image ready to go. And if you want to support a different aspect ratio and `webp`, well, I’m not even sure how to do the math. Sounds like a production nightmare.
-   **A production nightmare.** In the spirit of doing everything myself I initially wrote a script (first using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), eventually using [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/)) to generate the needed image variations. It worked but it meant building hundreds of them and it became obvious this the wrong way to go about it. Image services, like [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io/), are built for exactly this use case. You upload a large source file and it serves the image at any size, aspect ratio, and with many other transformation options. Ok, so we’re done then? Not quite.
-   **Images never seen.** Assuming you’ve got your responsive images pulling from your image service you still need to consider how loading all those images affects performance. Despite being around for years lazy loading is only now starting to make its way natively into browsers. Until better supported [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) is the way to go. Its primary purpose is to prevent images from loading outside of the viewport. But it does one other critical task needed for responsive images to work correctly: calculating the `sizes` attribute. This value is ordinarily [hardcoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#How_do_you_create_responsive_images), but if the layout changes and this value is not updated you can easily send the wrong image, defeating the purpose of responsive images. On-the-fly calculations of the attribute is the only long term solution.
-   **Layout jumps**. Still another thing to consider. Ordinarily when a page is loading the browser has no idea what sizes the images will be, so it’s common to see content “jump” as they appear. To avoid this we need to hardcode an aspect ratio that is passed to an inline style to create a placeholder, for example, `padding-top:calc(5/8 * 100%)`. It’s extra work, especially if you have to account for different aspect ratios at different breakpoints, but it means pages will load smoothly regardless of connection speed.

**2. `preload` critical fonts.** If I were trying to keep my site as fast as possible I’d use system fonts. But I’m a little vain and wanted to test out best practices for loading custom fonts. Before the page renders I’m using `preload` on two font weights. This does create a slight delay but I avoid layout jumps from unstyled type.

**3. Cache fonts.** `cache-control` One of Netlify’s great features is the ability to quickly rollback if a deploy goes wrong. But for the custom fonts that I have no intention of changing I’ve set `cache-control = "public, max-age=31536000"`. This means subsequent page loads feel much faster.

**4. `preconnect` and `dns-prefetch`.** These provide ways of asking the browser to do [remote DNS lookups](https://web.dev/preconnect-and-dns-prefetch/) of resources not served by your domain. On this site it’s being used for the image service.

**5.`async` on script tags.** Provides parallel fetching of JavaScript files that don’t need to be downloaded in a specific order.

**6. instant.page.** When a user hovers over an anchor this [script](https://instant.page/) assumes it will be clicked and preloads the HTML for that page. It’s a small amount of data and provides a slightly faster user experience, mainly on desktop.

**7. Functional CSS.** I wrote about [my experience](/write/functional-css.html) introducing this CSS approach to the engineering team at Thumbtack and am using it to power much of this site. Used with `purgecss` described above the main CSS file this site delivers to the client is `3.4kb`.

## Other tools

I wrote a few one-off scripts to help with image production.

-   [Screenshots](https://github.com/tomgenoni/genoni-dev/tree/master/tools). These take a remote or local screenshot as the source and add a generic gray [browser chrome bar](https://ik.imagekit.io/kdzcwco6qw/tt-home.jpg?tr=w-1024) at the top. This saved me a lot of time as it ensured screenshots would be the same size without having resize, crop, and edit manually.
