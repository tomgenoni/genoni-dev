The concept for Inkling was to port existing college textbooks to a new digital format with interactive features not possible prior to the introduction of the iPad. This not only meant creating a user experience surpassing its printed counterpart, but inventing tools to support our designers, developers, and editors trying to bring this entirely new book production process to scale. Though the original vision for the product did not succeed it was an exciting period and I built many [functional prototypes](/write/inkling.html), documentation engines, created and managed the design system for the books, and contributed code and tools to our primary editing tool, [Habitat](https://www.inkling.com/info/habitat/).
