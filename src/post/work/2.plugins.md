[Pointbreak](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pointbreak/cokghbfmenpjjpgbiojoohglhbljlbha?hl=en) solves a long-standing problem of developers repeatedly narrowing their browsers to check breakpoint layouts. A second tool inspired by a [presentation](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2013/06/05/creating-living-style-guides-to-improve-performance) from CSSConf founder [Nicole Sullivan](https://twitter.com/stubbornella) is called [CSS Dig](https://www.cssdig.com/). It scrutinizes website CSS to find color, type, and spacing values that are candidates for consolidation. And with Figma's plugin architecture it’s easy to add custom functionality for designers. I’ve built a number of them.
