One of the most satisfying aspects of my work is finding new ways to make designers (and sometimes developers) lives easier. To do this I’ve built a number of Chrome extensions and plugins. [Pointbreak](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pointbreak/cokghbfmenpjjpgbiojoohglhbljlbha?hl=en), for example, solves a long-standing problem of developers inevitably widening and narrowing their browsers to check layouts at various breakpoints. A second tool inspired by a [presentation](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2013/06/05/creating-living-style-guides-to-improve-performance) from CSSConf founder [Nicole Sullivan](https://twitter.com/stubbornella) is called [CSS Dig](https://www.cssdig.com/). Among other things it scrutinizes website CSS to find color, type, and spacing values that are candidates for consolidation. And with growing popularity of Figma and their plug-in architecture, it’s now easy to add custom functionality for users. In addition to the annotation plug-in shown above I built a content generator to supply designers instant access to hundreds of Thumbtack’s category images.
