One of the aspects I enjoy most about my work is finding ways to make designers (and sometimes developers) lives easier. To do this I’ve built a number of Chrome extenstions and apps, among them [Pointbreak](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pointbreak/cokghbfmenpjjpgbiojoohglhbljlbha?hl=en). When building responsive sites developers inevitably widen and narrow their browsers to check layouts at various breakpoints, over and over. It’s tiresome and small details are easily missed. Inspired by a [presentation](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2013/06/05/creating-living-style-guides-to-improve-performance) from CSSConf founder [Nicole Sullivan](https://twitter.com/stubbornella) I created [CSS Dig](https://www.cssdig.com/). Among other things scrutinizes CSS programmatically to find color, type, and spacing values that are candidates for consolidation. And with growing popularity of Figma, their plug-in architecture makes it easy to add custom functionality for users. In addition to the annotation plug-in shown above I built a content generator to supply designers instant access to hundreds of Thumbtack’s category images.
