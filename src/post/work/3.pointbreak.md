I created this tool to solve a long-standing problem for me. When building responsive sites developers inevitably widen and narrow their browsers to check layouts at various breakpoints, over and over. Itâ€™s tiresome and small details are easily missed. This Chrome app allows users to create and reorder any number of views at any dimension. Used with [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) it will inject CSS changes without a reload and auto-reload all the views after edits made to HTML. I plan to eventually add more features, like synced scrolling, and convert it to a more robust Electron app.
