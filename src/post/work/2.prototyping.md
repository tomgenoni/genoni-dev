Years before designs systems was the mature concept I attended a presentation given by CSSConf founder [Nicole Sullivan](https://twitter.com/stubbornella) about her [refactor of Trulia](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2013/06/05/creating-living-style-guides-to-improve-performance). Among the auditing strategies she recommended—assessing buttons, colors, type sizes—a further step was to “grep your styles,” that is, scrutinize the CSS programmatically to find values that are candidates for consolidation. Inspired, I created [CSS Dig](https://www.cssdig.com/), a Chrome extension that accomplishes this in a visual way. It groups the CSS it finds on a web page and groups them by properties and values. It also provides selector length and specificity, surfacing other possible “code smells” that could be cause for concern.
