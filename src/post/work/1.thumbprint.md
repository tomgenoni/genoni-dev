The four-person Design Systems team at Thumbtack was officially formed in 2017 to build [Thumbprint](https://thumbprint.design). Expanding on the SCSS library I’d started, we created platform-agnostic [design tokens](https://thumbprint.design/tokens/scss/), an icon library, [React components](https://thumbprint.design/components/overview/), and spearheaded the implementation of the 2018 Thumbtack [rebrand](https://thumbtack.com/brand/). I continued to maintain the SCSS codebase, wrote and contributed to React components, authored Thumbprint’s long-form documentation, created Figma plug-ins, built custom native prototyping system for experiments and user testing, and presented at company-wide meetings. Among my biggest contributions were building our functional CSS library [Atomic](/write/functional-css.html) and leading the effort to create a [responsive image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) component to integrate with our image service, significantly reducing developer time and bytes sent to our users.
