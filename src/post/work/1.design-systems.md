In one form or another Iâ€™ve been working with design systems for nearly 10 years. This began with pattern libraries and tooling at [Inkling](write/inkling.html) as we scaled our book production. A few years later at [Optimizely](https://css-tricks.com/optimizelys-ui-library-oui-1-of-2/) I consolidated their inconsistent user experience into a set of simply-styled HTML components for use in their products. My most intensive work in this space, however, was with a four-person Design Systems team at Thumbtack. With a 2018 [rebranding](https://thumbtack.com/brand/) as our starting point we built [Thumbprint](https://thumbprint.design), a now mature combination platform-agnostic [design tokens](https://thumbprint.design/tokens/scss/), an icon library, components on  [multiple platforms](https://thumbprint.design/components/overview/), and robust documentation. Among my biggest contributions were researching and authoring its long-form entires, building and socializing our functional CSS library [Atomic](/write/functional-css.html), and leading the effort to create a [responsive image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) component that integrated with our image service.
