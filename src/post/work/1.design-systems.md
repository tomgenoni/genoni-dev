My design systems work began with pattern libraries and tooling at [Inkling](write/inkling.html) to scale their book production. Continuing this work at [Optimizely](https://www.atomeye.com/writing/building-ui-library.html) I consolidated their inconsistent user experience into a set of simply-styled components. My most intensive project, however, was as a founding member of a four-person Design Systems team at Thumbtack. With a 2018 [rebranding](https://thumbtack.com/brand/) as our starting point we built [Thumbprint](https://thumbprint.design), a now mature combination of platform-agnostic [design tokens](https://thumbprint.design/tokens/scss/), an icon library, components on [multiple platforms](https://thumbprint.design/components/overview/), and robust documentation. Iâ€™ve continued this type of work as a designer, developer, and consultant at [Genoni Studio](https://genoni.studio/) by building design systems for small startups.
