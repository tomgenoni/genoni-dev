Related to the building plug-ins and extensions much of the time a simple website with some custom interaction and data will do the trick. At Thumbtack the Brand team had created 72 new illustrations and to track them I had our designer enter the image IDs into a spreadsheet. Using that as a database I could generate all the illustrations that would be referenced by developers. Additionally, to preview how images would render at different sizes and aspect ratios I build an image viewer. It reflects all the options our image service provides and the URL can be shared by anyone in the company. And the Thumbprint Icon library, a non-public part of the [Thumbprint Design System](https://thumbprint.design/), is another example of building a UI to help users find icons and the code they needed to use them. There are many other examples of web tools I’ve built featured in [Building Inkling’s Digital Books](/write/inkling.html) post.
