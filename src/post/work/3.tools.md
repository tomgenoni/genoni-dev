In may cases a simple website with some custom interaction and data will do the trick. At Thumbtack the Brand team had created new illustrations but with no easy way to reference them for developers. To track them I had our designer enter the image IDs into a spreadsheet, using it as a database to generate a list of the illustrations. Additionally, to preview how images would render at different sizes and aspect ratios, I build an image viewer. It includes all the options our image service provides and the URL can be shared by anyone in the company to ensure they are rendering as expected. And the Thumbprint Icon library, a non-public part of the [Thumbprint Design System](https://thumbprint.design/), is another example of building a UI to help users find icons and the code they needed to use them. There are many other examples of web tools I’ve built featured in [Building Inkling’s Digital Books](/write/inkling.html) post.
