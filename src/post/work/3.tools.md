At Thumbtack the Brand team had created a library of new illustration and to track them I had our designer enter the image IDs into a spreadsheet, using it as a database. And to preview how images would render at different sizes and aspect ratios I built an image viewer. It includes all the options our image service provides and the URL can be shared by anyone in the company to ensure illustrations are rendering as expected.
